1.3 - * Fixed name clashes with built-in types
      * Refactored unit test primer to auto-load unit tests
      * Fixed bug in MacroCommand.execute() where the list of commands was
        consumed after the first execution
      * Set proxy data anyway because some objects (like an empty strings,
        lists, dicts, etc) can fail the if statement method
      * Always use instance attributes instead of class level attributes
      * Refactored Facade.removeProxy() method
      * Added missing IView.removeObserver() method
      * Added missing Facade.hasMediator method
      * Raise from interface classes NotImplementedError(self) for verbose
        exception
      * Missing inheritance from INotifier for facade, command and mediator
        interfaces
      * dict.get() returns None by default if no key was found
      * Use "is" instead of "=" operator when comparing to None

1.2 - * Added install command to fab file
      * Renamed tests folder
      * Ignore build dir
      * Remove use of old-style classes (fixes potential MRO conflicts)
      * Mediator name and Proxy name cannot be None (raises a ValueError)
      * Fix problem where a notification removes a observer (Unittest added)
      * Fixed IProxy method definitions
