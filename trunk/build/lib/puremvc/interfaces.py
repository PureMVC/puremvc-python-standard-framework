	Implement a notification callback method.
	
	Implement methods that are called when the IMediator is registered or removed from the View.

	PureMVC does not rely upon underlying event models such

	The Observer Pattern as implemented within PureMVC exists 
	to support event-driven communication between the 
	application and the actors of the MVC triad.
	
	Notifications are not meant to be a replacement for Events
	in Flex/Flash/AIR. Generally, C{IMediator} implementors
	place event listeners on their view components, which they
	then handle in the usual way. This may lead to the broadcast of C{Notification}s to 
	trigger C{ICommand}s or to communicate with other C{IMediators}. C{IProxy} and C{ICommand}
	instances communicate with each other and C{IMediator}s by broadcasting C{INotification}s.
	
	A key difference between Flash C{Event}s and PureMVC 
	C{Notification}s is that C{Event}s follow the 
	'Chain of Responsibility' pattern, 'bubbling' up the display hierarchy 
	until some parent component handles the C{Event}, while
	PureMVC C{Notification}s follow a 'Publish/Subscribe'
	pattern. PureMVC classes need not be related to each other in a 
	parent/child relationship in order to communicate with one another
	using C{Notification}s.
